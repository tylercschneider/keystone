# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Keystone UI is a Rails gem providing reusable UI components built on `view_component`. It provides UI primitives that avoid ERB noise, prevent UI drift, and enable safe mass updates.

## Commands

```bash
bundle install              # Install dependencies
bundle exec rspec           # Run all tests
bundle exec rspec spec/keystone/ui/button_component_spec.rb  # Run a single test file
rake keystone:claude        # Append API reference to consuming app's CLAUDE.md
```

No build step or linter is configured.

## Architecture

This is a Rails engine gem structured around ViewComponent. The three-layer architecture is:

1. **Components** (`app/components/keystone/ui/`) — Ruby classes inheriting `ViewComponent::Base` with explicit keyword arguments, paired with `.html.erb` templates. All UI logic lives here.
2. **Helpers** (`app/helpers/keystone_ui_helper.rb`) — Thin render wrappers that delegate to components. Helpers contain no logic or conditionals. Consuming apps use helpers, not component classes directly.

Components use Tailwind CSS utility classes directly. The engine ships a CSS file (`app/assets/tailwind/keystone_ui_engine/engine.css`) with `@source` directives that tell Tailwind where to scan for classes. Host apps require `tailwindcss-rails` v4+.

## Design Principles

- All UI lives in ViewComponents (no partials).
- Components are Ruby objects with explicit keyword arguments.
- Helpers are thin render wrappers with no logic or conditionals.
- Styling uses Tailwind CSS utility classes applied directly in components.

## Testing

Tests use RSpec. The spec helper stubs `ViewComponent::Base` so tests run without a full Rails environment. Tests validate component logic (class composition, tag options, normalization) rather than rendered HTML.

## Key Conventions

- Ruby >= 3.0.0 required.
- Components live under the `Keystone::Ui` namespace.
- The DataTableComponent uses Tailwind CSS utility classes with predefined position-based class constants (first/middle/last cell styling). It accepts `items` (AR objects or hashes) and `columns` (simple `{ key: "Label" }` hashes or `Keystone::Ui::Column` objects), resolving cell values automatically. `Column` objects support per-column options like `mobile_hidden: true` which appends `hidden sm:table-cell` classes. A block-based API registers links via `table.link(:column_key) { |item| url }` and actions via `table.actions { |item| ... }`. When an actions column is present, position classes shift so the actions column gets LAST styling.
- GridComponent uses a `COL_CLASSES` frozen hash mapping `{breakpoint => {count => "literal-class"}}` for cols 1-12 across `default`, `sm`, `md`, `lg` breakpoints. All Tailwind classes are complete static strings (never interpolated) so the JIT scanner can detect them. Gap classes use the same pattern via `GAP_CLASSES`, `GAP_X_CLASSES`, and `GAP_Y_CLASSES` constants.
- ButtonComponent conditionally renders `<a>` or `<button>` based on whether `href` is provided.
